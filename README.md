# -Hyperledger-Fabric-Smart-Contract-with-IPFS
This assignment builds upon assignment A2 in which you developed a smart contract for an Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) blockchain. Thus, this assignmentâ€™s requirements are very similar to those of your assignment A3-Ethereum-with-IPFS, except that instead of using the Ethereum blockchain, you need to use HLF.
